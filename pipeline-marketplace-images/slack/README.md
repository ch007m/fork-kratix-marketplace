          containers:
            - image: ...
              name: ...

              name: slack
```

This image uses [Slack Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to
send notifications to Slack.

## Pre-requisites

For this image to work, you will first need to [setup the
webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) and store the URL in a
Kubernetes Secret in your platform cluster:

```shell
kubectl --namespace default create secret generic \
  slack-channel-hook --from-literal=url=<SLACK HOOK URL>
```

## Usage in the Pipeline

Add the image to the workflow definition in your Promise.

This image is intented to be used alongide with other container images in a
Promise Pipeline. It relies on the existence of one or more YAML files in a
`/kratix/metadata/notifications` with the following format:

```yaml
message: The message to be sent
slackHook:
  secretName: slack-channel-hook
  namespace: default
  # OR
  url: https://slack.hook.example.url
```

If `slackHook.url` is provided, the pipeline image will send the `message` to that URL.

If `slackHook.secretName` is provided, the pipeline image will first fetch the URL from
the Kubernetes Secret in the specified namespace.

### Avoiding multiple notifications

This image makes use of `/kratix/metadata/status.yaml` to determine if the
notifications were successfully sent in a previous pipeline run. To ensure the
image does not send a new notification with every run, ensure to store the
initial `object.yaml` status in `/kratix/metadata/status.yaml` in a previous pipeline
stage.
